Problem 2: H4$H Browns
Bessie the cow really likes potatoes, so she always gets hash browns for breakfast. 
Unfortunately, Farmer John has had a particularly bad year with potatoes, and can no longer 
supply Bessie with potatoes for her hash browns. Remembering that she is a student at the Moo 
Institute of Tractorology, Bessie signs into one of her many *free* Amazing Student accounts 
(an online marketplace) to buy potatoes from elsewhere.

So far at school, Bessie has made N (1 <= N <= 1000) accounts (all *free*), and since there is 
a limit on how many potatoes can be bought per account, she would like to use all of her 
accounts to maximize the number of potatoes (and thus, hash browns) that she can acquire.

At checkout, Bessie realizes that she needs to re-enter her credit card information for that 
account in order to confirm her identity. Unfortunately, Bessie has M (1 <= M <= 1000) 
different credit cards, and each of her Amazing Student accounts is linked to exactly one. 
What's worse, Amazing Student has hashed her credit card number, and Bessie doesn't know
which card each account corresponds with!

Luckily for her, Bessie learns on HeapUnderflow (a forum) that the hash is performed by taking 
each of D digits (5 <= D <= 20), adding the fourth power of the index and the fourth power of 
D - index, multiplying that by D2, then doing an integer divide by (D - 3)2 to obtain a 
sequence of D integers.

Mathematically, the "hash" for a digit d, for some length D, at an index k, is

(d + k4 + (D - k)4) * D2 / (D - 3)2

Given the poorly-hashed credit card numbers, please help Bessie determine which credit card 
number corresponds to which account, so that she can buy herself some 'taters!

INPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: Three integers, N, M, and D.
* Line 2..M+1: D digits, corresponding to one of Bessie's credit card numbers. This is guaranteed to be unique.
* Line M+2..N+M+3: D space-separated integers, representing the hashes of Bessie's credit card numbers.

SAMPLE INPUT (stdin):
3 4 5
54100
15012
20162
32123
3937 1631 612 606 1606
3925 1618 612 618 1625
3937 1631 612 606 1606

OUTPUT FORMAT:
N lines of output. Line i contains the credit card number for the hash given on line i+M+1.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (stdout):
54100
32123
54100

EXPLANATION:

To hash 54100, for example, we start with the 5, which is at index 0. Thus, its hashed value 
is int((5 + 04 + (5 - 0)4) * 52 / (5 - 3)2)= 3937. Other numbers are computed similarly.

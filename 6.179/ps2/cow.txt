Problem 1: Spherical Cows
In the not-too-distant future, spherical shapes have become the "in" look for cows. Not only 
does this minimize the surface area of the cow (to help it preserve heat), it also makes them 
much more raceable.

Farmer Jane has challenged Farmer John to a spherical cow race, and after many moo-ns of 
planning, the race is underway!

Bessie the cow acquired a radial injury the week before the race, so she cannot compete, but 
since it's mating season, she would still like to know which bull in the bull's races is the 
fastest. Since there are a lot of competitors, each bull only races once, so Bessie needs to 
make sure that she misses nothing. Fortunately, Bessie did her research prior to the race.

The innermost lane of the racetrack is 10 * M (1 <= M <= 1000000) lengths of hay long, with 
the next-innermost lane being 10% longer, the next one after that 20%, and so on. There are L 
(2 <= L <= 1000) lanes on the track, so the longest lane length is M * (10 + (L - 1)).

Each race has B (1 <= B <= L) bulls, each uniquely labeled by a positive integer K (1 <= K <= 
1010), and R (1 <= R <= 8) laps. For each bull, Bessie has noted that bull's time for each lap in 
milliseconds (her stopwatch only goes as high as 109), as well as which lane that 
bull is in. It turns out, these bulls are really fast!

Bessie defines the "speed" of a bull by (total distance) / (total time), and she would like to 
know which bull has the highest speed.

Given N (1 <= N <= 1000) races, such that N * L <= 10000, please help Bessie find the fastest, 
fittest bull! If two bulls are as fast as each other, choose the one that competed last -- he 
has a bigger impression on Bessie!

Since we are comparing floating points, consider two doubles equal if their absolute 
difference is no greater than 10-6.

INPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: Three integers, N, M, and L.
* Line 2: For the first race, two integers, B and R.
* Line 3..B+2: K, followed by R integers. K is the label for the current bull. The first bull in a race is in the innermost lane, each succeeding bull is in the next lane.
* Line B+3: For the second race, two integers, B and R.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
A single integer, the label of the bull with the greatest speed.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (stdout):
5

OUTPUT EXPLANATION:

Bull 1 rolled 2000 lengths of hay in a total of 2000 milliseconds, for a speed of 1.000000 lengths per millisecond.
Bull 2 rolled 2200 lengths of hay in a total of 1900 milliseconds, for a speed of 1.157894 lengths per millisecond.
Bull 3 rolled 3000 lengths of hay in a total of 2500 milliseconds, for a speed of 1.200000 lengths per millisecond.
Bull 4 rolled 3300 lengths of hay in a total of 2700 milliseconds, for a speed of 1.222222 lengths per millisecond.
Bull 5 rolled 3600 lengths of hay in a total of 2600 milliseconds, for a speed of 1.384615 lengths per millisecond.

Bull 5 has the highest speed, so we output 5.

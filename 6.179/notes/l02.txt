*** Arrays do not know their length; they do not change their size.

*** Functions cannot return arrays created as such…pass in the array you want to fill or modify, or wait until malloc().

>>> Strings

Just character arrays - char[].

Null terminated: char[] s = {‘H’, ‘i’, ‘\0’}

char[] s = “Hi”

#include <string.h>

	strcpy, strcat, strlen

printf(…)

	“%\n” means “put decimal/int value, then new line

for (int i = 0; i < blah; i++) {}

while () {}

When compile, add -std=c99 if init i in for loop.

switch() {} - be sure to break

>>> Reading input.

scanf() - Reads a formatted string from console

i.e. scanf(“%d %d”, &i, &j)

>>> Pointers.

& - gives pointer to variable.
* - dereferences a pointer > gets the value.

(See code for actual examples.)

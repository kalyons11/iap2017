IAP January 2017 at MIT.

### 6.179: Introduction to C and C++0. 
This course covers a broad scope of topics in the fundamental languages of C and C++. I now have a much greater understanding of the following topics as a result of this course:
- Memory allocation
- Computer architecture
- Pointer arithmetic
- Structure development
In addition, I have been able to complete many interesting topics/algorithms, including Mandlebrot fractals and Huffman encoding of binary sequences. More to come soon.

### [6.S097: 6.S097 Urban Data Analytics and Machine Learning.](http://web.mit.edu/6.S097/www/)
In looking for a greater understanding of machine learning early in my career, I decided to take this course to be exposed in a practical way. We cover many key concepts in ML, inclduing:
- Classification and regression
- Training and test error
- Linear classifiers
- Clustering via nearest neighbors
- Support vector machines
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Neural nets
I am also taking this class as a precursor to MIT's [6.036](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.036/) that I will be taking Spring 2017. More to come soon.

### 6.057 Introduction to MATLAB.
This class begins on Monday, January 30th. More to come soon.
